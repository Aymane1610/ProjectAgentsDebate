[INTERNAL MEMO - HR DATA 2024]
SUBJECT: REAL PLACEMENT STATS & INTERNSHIP REALITY

1. CIVIL ENGINEERING PLACEMENT DISPARITY
While the official brochure claims "high demand," the reality is strictly regional.
- Fes-Meknes Region: 100% placement rate (local construction boom).
- Casablanca/Rabat: Only 40% placement rate.
  (Reason: Competition form EHTP and EMI in Casablanca is too strong for UPF grads).

2. SCHOLARSHIP TRAP "ARTICLE 12"
The brochure mentions "annual validation."
The reality (Article 12 of Financial Regulations):
- If a student's annual average drops below 12/20, the scholarship is CANCELLED immediately.
- If a student retakes a year (redoublement), the scholarship is permanently lost.
- Refund Policy: If a student leaves mid-year, the full year tuition is due.

3. UNPAID INTERNSHIPS
- Civil Engineering 3rd Year Internship: Mandatory 2 months.
- Status: 95% of these internships are NON-PAID.
- Hidden Cost: Students must pay for their own transport/lodging if placed outside Fes.
  (Avg extra cost for student: 4,000 MAD/month).
